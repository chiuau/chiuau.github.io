		Fully autonomous vehicles are technologically feasible with the
current generation of hardware, as demonstrated by recent robot car
competitions.  Dresner and Stone proposed a new intersection control
protocol called \emph{Autonomous Intersection Management} (AIM) and
showed that with autonomous vehicles it is possible to make
intersection control much more efficient than the traditional control
mechanisms such as traffic signals and stop signs.  The protocol,
however, has only been tested in simulation and has not been evaluated
with real autonomous vehicles.  To realistically test the protocol, we
implemented a mixed reality platform on which an autonomous vehicle
can interact with multiple virtual vehicles in a simulation at a real
intersection in real time.  From this platform we validated realistic
parameters for our autonomous vehicle to safely traverse an
intersection in AIM.  We present several techniques to improve
efficiency and show that the AIM protocol can still outperform traffic
signals and stop signs even if the cars are not as precisely
controllable as has been assumed in previous studies.
