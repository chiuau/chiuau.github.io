<b>Brief Bio:</b>
In the past decade, I have been working on several topics in AI,
including automated planning, multi-agent systems,
robotics, and intelligent transportation systems.
Some of my research accomplishments include an effective strategy
for coping with noise in <a href="http://www.prisoners-dilemma.com">Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma</a>, a famous problem in game theory and the
study of the evolution of cooperation.  Since I joined <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu">the University of Texas at Austin</a> as a
postdoctoral fellow I has been working on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pbAI40dK0A">a new transportation system for
autonomous vehicles</a>.  At UNIST, my research interest
has been diversified into many different branches of AI, including
motion planning, machine learning, combinational optimization and heuristic search, 
applied computational logics, computational economics, object manipulation and computer vision in robotics, task planning, and cyber-physical systems.
I received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at <a
href="http://www.cs.umd.edu">University of Maryland, College Park</a> in 2008.
Previously I was a member of <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/research.shtml">Learning Agents Research
Group (LARG)</a> and the <a href="http://z.cs.utexas.edu/users/ai-lab">AI
Lab</a> in <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu">UTCS</a>, as well as 
a student in the <a
href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau">AI planning group</a> and the <a
href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/research/LCCD">Laboratory for Computational
Cultural Dynamics (LCCD)</a> in <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu">UMCP's CS
department</a>.

<b>Extended Goal Recognition Design</b>.
Goal recognition design (GRD) is the task of modifying environments to aid observers in recognizing the objectives of agents during online observations. We propose a new GRD framework called <i>extended goal recognition design</i> (EGRD) for multiple goal recognition in case an agent aims for a sequence of goals instead of just one goal.  In EGRD, we can use first-order computation tree logic to formulate goal conditions that can be weaker than exact goal recognition. The objective of EGRD is to modify an environment to minimize the worst case distinctiveness of a goal condition that describes how an agent can reach a set of goals.

<b>High-Density Parking for Autonomous Vehicles</b>.
Research in high-density parking (HDP) focuses on how to increase the capacity of parking lots by allowing vehicles to block each other but temporarily give way to other vehicles by driving autonomously upon request. Previous works on HDP did not consider mixing different parking strategies and ignored the possibility of gridlock when multiple vehicles move simultaneously. In this work, we propose the design of <i>autonomous parking lots</i>, which allows the deployment of different parking strategies in different regions in a parking lot. We present algorithms for checking whether adding a vehicle to an autonomous parking lot can lead to gridlock.  Our simulation shows that autonomous parking lots can hold 60% more vehicles given the same amount of space.

<b>Dynamic Robot Chains</b>.
When a team of robots moves many objects continuously, carrying objects from one place to another by individual robots may not be the most efficient way of transportation.  We design new kinds of mobile robots that can pass objects at a distance (e.g., mobile conveyor robots) and program them to form <i>robot chains</i> that connect the initial location of objects to the destination.  A robot chain can achieve a much higher throughput when transferring many objects along the robot chain simultaneously.  Our research on dynamic robot chains focuses on designing aerial and ground robots with different mechanisms of establishing robot chains on demand.  Moreover, we study how to deploy <i>dynamic robot chain networks</i> in foraging tasks in which robots have to search for resources such as minerals, water, and fuels that are distributed in an arena and bring them back to a collection zone.

<b>Fully Autonomous Racing Drones</b>.
A fully autonomous drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle that is entirely controlled by its onboard computer and sensors without any human intervention, and they do not rely on any external sensing or computational power.  In <i>autonomous drone racing</i>, we build and program fully autonomous drones that can fly in a cluttered environment as quickly as possible.  These drones can also perform some tasks (e.g., delivering an object to a target location) while flying through the obstacles. In addition, we propose methods to <i>extend the range of delivery drones</i> by machine learning.

<b>Planning and Scheduling of Mobile Robots with Production Machinery</b>.
Recent advances in warehouse robots, notably the automated guided vehicles (AGVs) developed by Amazon Robotics (formerly Kiva Systems), have revolutionized the operations of large distribution centers of online retailers. Inspired by these systems, we designed new robotic systems that <i>combine mobile robots with production machinery</i> such that the manufacturing process can overlap with the delivery process.  The key to unlocking the power of these robotic systems is a better scheduling algorithm.  In the end, we are interested in designing high throughput robotic systems using better scheduling and planning algorithms.

While the control of these autonomous vehicles is good enough for driving on today's roads, more precise control of autonomous vehicles can lead to better utilization of road surfaces and reduce traffic congestion.  We theoretically examined the relationship between the precision of cars' motion control and the throughput of an intersection.  We also developed <i>a constant-time reachability-checking algorithm</i> for checking whether an autonomous vehicle can arrive at a given target location on a trajectory at a given arrival time and velocity.

<b>Autonomous Traffic Management</b>.
Looking ahead to the time when autonomous cars will be common, 
we study how to utilize the capacity of autonomous vehicles to make transportation systems
much more efficient.  Dresner and Stone proposed an intersection control protocol
for autonomous vehicle traffic called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM),
which is more efficient than traffic signals and stop signs.
In this project, we expand the scope of AIM to <i>autonomous traffic management</i>
in road networks and aim to find out the best transportation infrastructure
for traffic that consists of a mix of autonomous vehicles and non-autonomous vehicles.

<b>Composite Strategies.</b>
To create better agents in multiagent environments, one may want to examine the observed behaviors of existing agents in order to combine their best skills.  But the agents being observed may exhibit incompatible behaviors---the agents choose to do different things in some situations---and it is not immediately clear which behavior is better.  We proposed a technique to identify the best subset of observed behaviors, in forms of <i>interaction traces</i>, that can be combined together to form a new strategy called <i>composite strategy</i> that potentially outperforms all agents being observed.  In our experiments, the performance of nearly all agents increased after augmenting with composite strategies.

<b>Noise Detection in Non-Zero-Sum Games.</b>
An important question in many multiagent systems is how self-interested agents
can resolve conflicts and coordinate with each other to accomplish a task.
While existing strategies such as Tit-For-Tat and Pavlov work well in simple
games such as Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), they perform badly in the presence
of noise, which randomly changes the agents' actions or communications and
causes huge problems in maintaining cooperation among agents.
To deal with this long-standing problem of noise in the study of the evolution of
cooperation, we proposed several <i>noise detection techniques</i> and
demonstrated that these techniques is very effective in IPD and other non-zero-sum games.

<b>AI Planning with Volatile Information.</b>
In many planning problems (e.g., robotic task planning
and web service composition), an agent may need to acquire external
information during planning.  An important issue in planning with
external information is <i>information volatility</i>---the collected
information may change or expire before the termination of the
planning process.  For example, a web-based trip planner can generate
incorrect travel plans if it does not know the information provided
by an airline company has changed.  To address this problem,
we proposed several query management strategies for handling
volatile data and theoretically analyzed the conditions under
which the solutions returned by the planning process remain valid.
